    "text": "Description\nIn this unstructured exercise we would encourage you to\n\nconvert one of your own manuscripts into Quarto\nuse Quarto Manuscripts to create a website for this publication\npublish this website with Github Pages\n\nThe final result of the exercise could be a Quarto Manuscript website which serves as a hub containing everything necessary to reproduce your manuscript.\nFor this exercise, we do not provide step-by-step instructions. Instead we link to the relevant Quarto Manuscript documentation, provide an example of how the final result of the exercise could look like, and list the most important steps when converting a Quarto document into a Quarto Manuscripts website.\n\n\nWhat are Quarto Manuscripts?\nThe Quarto documentation on manuscripts reads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\n\n\nQuarto manuscript projects provide a framework for writing and publishing scholarly articles. A Quarto manuscript lets you:\n\nUse one or more notebooks or .qmd documents as the source of content and computations, and then publish these computations alongside the manuscript, allowing readers to dive into your code.\nProduce manuscripts in multiple formats (including LaTeX or MS Word formats required by journals), and give readers easy access to all of the formats through a manuscript website.\n\nThe output of a Quarto manuscript is a website (live example). The article itself appears as the content of the website, and can include all the elements common to scholarly writing like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations. The website also makes available other formats (e.g.¬†PDF, Docx) as well as links to all of the computations used to create the article.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nWe suggest that, before you start with your own Quarto manuscript, you have a look at the Getting Started tutorial on how to create a Quarto Manuscript website.\nAdditional documentation on Quarto Manuscripts can be found here.\n\n\n\nFinal result\nThe final result of the exercise could look something like this:\n\nWebsite\nCode\n\n\n\nSteps to convert a Quarto document into a Quarto Manuscripts project\nIf you already have written your manuscript with Quarto, there are only a small number of steps necessary to convert your document into a Quarto Manuscripts website. Without guarantee of completeness, the most important steps are:\n\nCreate the file _quarto.yml in your RStudio project. A good starting point for the content of this file is:\nproject:\n  type: manuscript\n\nmanuscript:\n  article: index.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    comments:\n      hypothesis: false\n  pdf: default\n  docx: default\n  jats: default\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\nThe main .qmd document containing your manuscript must be named index.qmd by default. If you want to use another name, adjust the line article: index.qmd in the file _quarto.yml.\nMake sure that you remove unnecessary (or conflicting) YAML options in your article and additional notebook .qmd files. We suggest to only use a minimum of options first, test that everything works and then add further options when needed.\nQuarto Manuscripts supports many useful YAML options that can be used in your index.qmd file. We suggest that you have a look on the Quarto documentation on scholarly writing this and consecutive pages.\nIf your project contains computations that take a long time to run, we suggest you make sure you understand how the freeze functionality of Quarto works by reading this and this.\nOptional: If you need to format your manuscript in APA style, you might want that 1) your Quarto Manuscripts website uses standard HTML themes and formatting but uses APA citation style, 2) your downloadable .pdf file is nicely formatted as a APA journal article that you can upload to the preprint server of your choice, and 3) your downloadable manuscript in .docx format is formatted as a APA manuscript, which is how many APA journals require manuscripts to be sent into peer review.\nYou can achieve this by\n\ndownloading the apa-quarto extension as explained in the previous exercise\nusing the following code in your _quarto.yml file:\nformat:\n  html: default\n  jats: default\n  apaquarto-pdf:\n    documentmode: jou\n    a4paper: true\n    pdf-engine: lualatex\n    keep-tex: false\n  apaquarto-docx: default\nusing the YAML option csl: apa.csl in the file index.qmd (the file apa.csl can be downloaded here)",
