Welcome to the **Quarto workshop**, initially designed for the [LMU OSC Summer School 2023](https://malikaihle.github.io/OSC-Open-Research-Summer-School-2023/).

## Structure and Workflow of the Workshop

This is a **self-paced tutorial** of about **2 hours** aimed at **early-career researchers**.
It covers the absolute basics of the scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The workshop is structured in 5 consecutive parts you can navigate to on the top of the website:

1. [Welcome](index.qmd) to the Quarto Workshop (**you are here now**)
2. [Quarto Tutorials](quarto_tutorials.qmd) from the official Quarto project
3. [Tips and Comments](comments.qmd) from our own experiences of using Quarto
4. [Links](links.qmd) to further resources


The [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) project has exceptionally well written tutorials ([Quarto "Getting Started"](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)) and online documentation ([Quarto "Guide"](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)).
Instead of reinventing the wheel, we will heavily link to these resources.

## What is Quarto?

If you have not seen many examples yourself, go to the official [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) or have a look at the following presentation for a few examples that were created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) or its predecessor [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
