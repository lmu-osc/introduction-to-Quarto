Welcome to the **Quarto workshop**, initially designed for [LMU OSC Summer School 2023](https://lmu-osc.github.io/OSC-Open-Research-Summer-School-2023/) and [LMU & MPG Open Science Summer School 2024](https://osip.mpdl.mpg.de/lmu-mpg-open-science-summer-school-2024/).

## Structure and Workflow of the Workshop

This is a **self-paced tutorial** of about **2 hours** aimed at **early-career researchers**.
It covers the absolute basics of the scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) while using [R in RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html).

The workshop is structured in 4 consecutive parts you can navigate to on the top of the website, on the sidebar, or with the arrows at the bottom of each page:

1. [Welcome](index.qmd) to the Quarto Workshop (**you are here now**)
2. [Quarto Tutorials](quarto_tutorials.qmd) from the official Quarto project
3. [Tips and Comments](comments.qmd) from our own experiences of using Quarto
4. [Advanced Exercises](quarto_exercises.qmd) that are more challenging than the beginner Quarto tutorials
5. [Links](links.qmd) to further resources


The Quarto project provides well written tutorials ([Quarto "Getting Started"](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)) and online documentation ([Quarto "Guide"](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)).
Instead of reinventing the wheel, we will heavily link to these resources.

## What is Quarto?

The official [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website reads:

## Quote:

An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

- Author using Jupyter notebooks or with plain text markdown in your favorite editor.
- Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
- Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
- Share knowledge and insights organization-wide by publishing to Posit Connect, Confluence, or other publishing systems.
- Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

Analyze. Share. Reproduce. You have a story to tell with dataâ€”tell it with Quarto.
:::

These features make Quarto an extremely useful tool for researchers to:

- write reproducible research reports, presentations or scientific articles
- create personal of project websites
- publish tutorials, textbooks, or other educational resources online
- and much more...

If you have not seen many examples yourself, go to the official [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/), the [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/), or have a look at the following presentation for a few examples, where we have used Quarto in our own work:
